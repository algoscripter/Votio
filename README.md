# Votio

# Current branch of work is [authentication](https://github.com/terakilobyte/votio/tree/authentication).
### Heavily broken as I'm learning. Initial design decisions may have to be relooked! Lessons being learned.

To start the application:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### Votio
This is a simple learning project that I'll be keeping a [(b)log of](http://terakilobyte.com). Each major milestone will live on its' own branch.
